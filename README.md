# DataStructures_Learning
For me to learn how to implement data structures

This went down a rabbit hole further then i had initially intended.
What started out with the implementing data structures on C# to understand the intricacies of datastructures
became a long drawn exploration of OpenGL, the GLSL (Shader programming) and OpenTK (C# bindings of OpenGL, otherwise i would have gone and learnt C++ which would be another rabbit hole unto itself)
Being a Computational Designer from the architecture industry, I had little exposure to the basics of Computer Science, hence the initial intent to learn data structures.
The first data structure I went to learn and implement took me on the route of Computer Graphics, OcTree...
